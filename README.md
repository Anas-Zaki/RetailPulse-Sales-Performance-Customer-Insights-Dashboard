## 🧹 Data Cleaning

We used **Pandas** to clean the dataset before importing it into Power BI. Key steps included:
- Removing duplicates and null values
- Standardizing date columns and category names
- Fixing data types (e.g., `Order Date`, `Sales`, `Profit`)

## 🛠️ Power BI Features Used

We used Power BI to transform, model, and visualize the data. Key Power BI concepts included:

- **Data Transformations** in Power Query
- **Star Schema** modeling
- **DAX Measures**: Total Sales, Total Profit, Avg. Discount, YTD Sales, and more
- **Time Intelligence**: Sales & Profit by Quarter, MTD & YTD trends
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: To restrict views based on salesperson/region
- **Custom Visuals**: For interactive and dynamic dashboards

---

## 🧠 SQL Analysis

We also performed SQL queries using **MySQL** and connected it through Python. Key insights included:

- Total sales and total profit generated by the company
- Top 5 products by highest sales
- Sales distribution by region and state
- Average discount for each product category
- Top 5 customers based on total profit
- Total sales and quantity for each sub-category
